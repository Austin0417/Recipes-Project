# Recipes-Project
GUI Application made with the Qt framework in C++ that is used for creating, storing, editing, and deleting recipes. Users can also search for recipes, and all of the user's recipes are displayed in a straightforward list view. Users can either left click twice on a recipe in the list to view it's informations and contents, or right click for additional interactive options. A login system is also incorporated into the app, utilizing PostgreSQL. This allows for users to save their information, as well as supporting the capability for multiple users to use the application. There is also a calendar functionality to the app, which allows users to click on a date within the calendar, and add an event. This can be used to organize meals, or just general use.
